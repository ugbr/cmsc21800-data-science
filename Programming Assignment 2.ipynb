    "# Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will study how to leverage \"Agent\"-based simulation to understand complex questions. An agent-based model (ABM) is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) in order to understand the behavior of a system and what governs its outcomes. We will show how Python programming can be used to build simple, but effective agent-based simulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grocery Store Checkout Line Optimization** You’re at the grocery store rolling a cart filled with all the essentials like pizza bagels, ice cream and hummus. Now all you want to do after a long day is get home to watch the latest episode of “Game of Thrones.” As you approach the checkout area, your eyes widen with horror. Every single line snakes back through the aisles. Other irritated shoppers are restlessly eyeing the other lines to see which one is the shortest—which only makes you more antsy. We want to understand how stores can optimize checkout lines by allocating resources to regular lines or \"express\" lines (e.g., 10 items or less). This seems like a challenging problem, but we will try to break it down into smaller pieces that we can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recipe for ABM Problems \n",
    "There are three key questions when starting with any ABM problem. \n",
    "* **What** Write down what do we want to discover with the ABM problem.\n",
    "* **Who** Write down all of the key \"agents\" in the system (entities that take actions)\n",
    "* **How** Write down all of the key formulas and distributiosn that govern agent actions\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this work in our grocery store problem?\n",
    "* **What** \"I want a model to show that replacing a regular line with an express line can improve average customer satisfaction by reducing the average waiting time\"\n",
    "* **Who** There are three key agents in the problem: Store, Users, and Lines (a proxy for checkout employees).\n",
    "* **How** We will use a D/U/K queueing model to describe customer arrivals and service, a Poisson distribution model for describing customer basket sizes, and a dissatisfaction model for customers where dissatisfaction is directly proportional to waiting time divided by expected service time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming our Agents\n",
    "Now that we know the basics of our problem, let's actually code the agents. First, let's start with our \"Store\" Agent. The \"store\" will manage the entire simulation and maintain the key parameters."
